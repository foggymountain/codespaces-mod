Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house,
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim viaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front,
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds, 
to fright the souls of fearfil adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a ladies chamber,
to the lacivious pleasing of a lute.
